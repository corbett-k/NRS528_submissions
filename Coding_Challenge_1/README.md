# **Kris Corbett Bio:**

I am currently a 2nd year M.S. student in the Biological and Environmental Sciences program at the University of Rhode Island. My thesis research is primarily focused on assessing the distribution and abundance of coastal waterbirds using Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS), or drones.

Prior to arriving at URI in the Fall of 2020, I worked in the Everglades for six months on a long-term research project run by the University of Florida. In addition to performing the usual tasks of a field technician, I was also the project's drone pilot, responsible for collecting aerial imagery of wading bird colonies located on remote tree island's deep inside this unique landscape.

Before departing for South Florida, I spent three years working for the Missouri Department of Conservation as an Assistant Natural History Biologist. Working with the state's Natural Heritage Program, I was fortunate to assist a variety of projects focused on rare and threatened species. While the fieldwork experiences were highlights of this position, I also spent a fair amount of time maintaining the extensive (and sensitive) GIS database containing information on statewide occurences of hundreds of vulnerable species spanning nearly every taxonomic group.
